#Burger Builder Application w/ ReactJS

## App Description

This is a basic Burger Builder Application with ReactJS.
It includes React's component architecture and layout standard. 
How can we use it dynamically and mobile responsive.

I started to code it with <pre>create-react-app</pre> command.

But you can use <b>npm</b> or <b>yarn</b> to install dependencies. 

### What I used?

- HTML5

- Webpack
- Pure JavaScript

then
<pre>npm start</pre>
